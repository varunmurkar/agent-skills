  Compress natural language memory files (CLAUDE.md, todos, preferences) into caveman format
  to save input tokens. Preserves all technical substance, code, URLs, and structure.
  Compressed version overwrites the original file. Human-readable backup saved as FILE.original.md.
  Trigger: /caveman:compress <filepath> or "compress memory file"

# Caveman Compress

## Purpose

Compress natural-language files (`CLAUDE.md`, todos, preferences) into caveman-speak. Overwrite original; backup as `<filename>.original.md`.

## Trigger

`/caveman:compress <filepath>` or request to compress memory file.

## Process

1. Find directory containing this `SKILL.md` + sibling `scripts/`.
2. Run:

cd <directory_containing_this_SKILL.md> && python3 -m scripts <absolute_filepath>

3. CLI flow:
- detect file type (no tokens)
- call Claude to compress
- validate output (no tokens)
- errors -> Claude cherry-pick targeted fixes; no full recompression
- retry up to 2 times
- still failing after 2 retries -> report error; leave original untouched

4. Return result.

## Compression Rules

### Remove

- Articles: a, an, the
- Filler: just, really, basically, actually, simply, essentially, generally
- Pleasantries: "sure", "certainly", "of course", "happy to", "I'd recommend"
- Hedging: "it might be worth", "you could consider", "it would be good to"
- Redundant phrasing: "in order to" -> "to", "make sure to" -> "ensure", "the reason is because" -> "because"
- Connective fluff: "however", "furthermore", "additionally", "in addition"

### Preserve EXACTLY (never modify)

- Code blocks (fenced ``` and indented)
- Inline code (`backtick content`)
- URLs and links (full URLs, markdown links)
- File paths (`/src/components/...`, `./config.yaml`)
- Commands (`npm install`, `git commit`, `docker build`)
- Technical terms (library names, API names, protocols, algorithms)
- Proper nouns (project names, people, companies)
- Dates, version numbers, numeric values
- Environment variables (`$HOME`, `NODE_ENV`)

### Preserve Structure

- exact markdown headings
- bullet hierarchy
- numbered lists
- table structure; compress cell text
- frontmatter/YAML headers

### Compress

- Short words: "big" not "extensive", "fix" not "implement a solution for", "use" not "utilize"
- Fragments OK: "Run tests before commit" not "You should always run tests before committing"
- Drop "you should", "make sure to", "remember to"
- Merge redundant bullets
- Keep one example per pattern

CRITICAL RULE:
Anything inside ``` ... ``` must be copied EXACTLY.
Do not:
- remove comments
- remove spacing
- reorder lines
- shorten commands
- simplify anything

Inline code (`...`) must be preserved EXACTLY.
Do not modify anything inside backticks.

Files with code blocks:
- code blocks read-only
- compress prose only
- do not merge sections around code

## Pattern

Original:
> You should always make sure to run the test suite before pushing any changes to the main branch. This is important because it helps catch bugs early and prevents broken builds from being deployed to production.

Compressed:
> Run tests before push to main. Catch bugs early, prevent broken prod deploys.

Original:
> The application uses a microservices architecture with the following components. The API gateway handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate service. The authentication service is responsible for managing user sessions and JWT tokens.

Compressed:
> Microservices architecture. API gateway route all requests to services. Auth service manage user sessions + JWT tokens.

## Boundaries

- ONLY natural-language files (`.md`, `.txt`, extensionless)
- NEVER modify: `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`, `.env`, `.lock`, `.css`, `.html`, `.xml`, `.sql`, `.sh`
- Mixed content -> compress prose only
- Unsure code/prose -> leave unchanged
- Backup original as `FILE.original.md` before overwrite
- Never compress `FILE.original.md`
